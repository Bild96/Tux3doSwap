#### Description
When transferring currencies between two accounts with the conventional financial system, an intermediary is often necessary to facilitate a transaction. Furthermore, these platforms are often referred to as centralized exchanges as theyâ€™re based on a centralized system. In contrast, a decentralized exchange, or a DEX, rather emulates the functionalities of a centralized exchange but is based on a decentralized system. What this basically means is that the back-end of these exchanges exists on a blockchain. 

#### How it's made
1. Setting up a Moralis server.
2. Installing the 1inch DEX plugin.
3. Creating an HTML file.
4. Creating a JavaScript file.
5. Assigning functions to each event.
6. Integrating Unstoppable domain login.
7. Deployed the project  in IPFS.
